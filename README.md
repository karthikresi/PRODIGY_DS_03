## Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
# Overview
This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. We use the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information about customers contacted through a direct marketing campaign, along with details such as their age, job, marital status, and the outcome of the marketing call.

The objective is to develop a predictive model that helps identify potential customers who are likely to purchase the product or service, allowing for more targeted marketing efforts.

# Objective
To preprocess and prepare the dataset for machine learning.
To build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data.
To evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
To visualize the decision tree to understand the decision-making process and key features.
# Prerequisites
To complete this task, you will need:

The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with the following libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical computations.
Scikit-learn for building machine learning models.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
# Steps
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset using Pandas and inspect its initial structure to understand the columns and data types.

# Data Preprocessing:

Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features for building the model.
Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Build the Decision Tree Classifier:

Use the DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn to train the model on the training data.
Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters (e.g., max depth, minimum samples per leaf) for optimal performance.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Visualize the decision tree to understand the decision rules and key features contributing to the model’s predictions.
